/**
 * Reads an uploaded file and reports what it holds.

 * <p>
 * This is one operation rather than one per resource, because what a file holds is the answer rather than the question:
 * a container can carry certificates, a private key, a secret key or a signing request in any combination, and a caller
 * uploading it does not yet know which. An operation under one resource would ask a caller to classify the file before
 * asking what it is.

            description = """
                    Report what an uploaded file holds, without importing or storing anything.

                    The file travels base64-encoded in `file`, like every upload in the platform, and is held in memory rather
                    than written anywhere; it is never echoed in an error, since it may carry key material. Every container the
                    platform understands is accepted, so a caller uploads once and then decides: PKCS#12 in any composition, a PEM bundle of certificates with at most one private
                    key, a standalone PKCS#8 key, plain or encrypted, an OpenSSL traditional PEM key, an OpenSSH private key, a
                    single certificate as PEM or DER, and PKCS#7. The container is recognised by its content, not by its file
                    name. JKS and JCEKS are refused with a message that says to convert them.

                    Nothing here has to be carried into a later operation. Each entry is reported with a reference derived from
                    the entry's own content, so an operation given that reference acts on that content whichever file it
                    arrives with. Read a file when a user should see what is inside before anything is imported; a caller that
                    already knows what it is sending does not need to.
