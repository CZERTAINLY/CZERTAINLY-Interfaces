                + "formatting connector implements this contract. The family interface codes it advertises on /v2/info "
                + "say which families it is entitled to serve. It MUST reject any other family with 422.\n\nThe seven "
                + "operations form three compute/embed pairs plus the fused extendToLevel. A pair exists wherever the "
                + "connector needs something only the platform can produce. That is a signature value, because private "
                + "keys never leave the platform. It is also a timestamp token, because timestamps are issued "
                + "platform-side. Validation material is deliberately not such an artifact. The connector fetches it "
                + "itself, inside extendToLevel, where the document already is.\n\nThe connector MUST be stateless. It "
                + "holds nothing between operations. Every request carries everything that operation needs. The only "
                + "value that crosses from a compute step to its embed step is formattingContext. The connector "
                + "produces it, and the platform replays it verbatim without inspecting or storing it. The connector "
                + "MUST NOT run timers or background jobs of its own. Any periodic work is a call the platform "
                + "makes.\n\nThe six pure-compute operations MUST be deterministic. An identical request MUST produce "
                + "a bit-identical result across connector replicas and versions. The platform relies on this: it "
                + "resumes an interrupted signing operation by replaying the operation sequence, rather than by "
                + "storing what each step returned. extendToLevel is the exception. It fetches, so its retry semantics "
                + "are refetch, not replay.\n\nThe connector MUST NOT read its own clock for anything that enters "
                + "signature content. The platform supplies signingTime, and the connector uses that value.\n\nEvery "
                + "operation has an attribute schema that configures it, read from that operation's route plus "
                + "/attributes. The platform collects those schemas when a Signing Profile is configured, and replays "
                + "the operator's chosen values in formattingAttributes on every call.\n\nA Signing Profile holds one "
                + "flat set of attribute values, not one set per operation. The platform merges the schemas of every "
                + "operation that profile can reach into a single set, keyed by attribute name. It sends that whole "
                + "set to every operation. Which operations are reachable depends on the level the profile is "
                + "configured up to.\n\nTwo consequences bind a connector. First, an operation MUST ignore any "
                + "attribute name its own schema does not declare, rather than rejecting it: that name belongs to a "
                + "sibling operation. The platform has already refused, at profile save, any name no reachable "
                + "operation declares. Second, an attribute declared by more than one operation MUST carry an "
                + "identical definition in every schema that lists it. The operator configures it once, and both "
                + "operations receive that one value. For the compute/embed twins that is the point rather than a "
                + "limitation. An imprint computed under one digest algorithm must be embedded expecting the same one, "
                + "and a single shared attribute makes that true by construction.")
