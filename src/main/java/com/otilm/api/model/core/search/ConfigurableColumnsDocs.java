            Ordering and columns address a field by its source together with its identifier, because an identifier is \

            searchable-fields operation of this resource.

            `sort` orders the whole result set before it is paged, so paging walks the sorted set rather than sorting \
            one page at a time; only fields the catalogue marks `sortable` may be used. `columns` names the fields the \
            response is to carry; only fields the catalogue marks `displayable` may be requested.

            A request that carries neither `sort` nor `columns` is answered exactly as it was before the two fields \
            existed: the endpoint's own default ordering, the full default shape of every object, and no \
            `attributeValues` member. A caller written against the previous contract therefore needs no change.""";

            empty, and a multi-valued attribute arrives in its stored `item_order`.""";

            `sortable` those the listing may be ordered by. A field that reports neither flag is filter-only, so an \
            absent flag is to be read as `false` rather than as unknown.
