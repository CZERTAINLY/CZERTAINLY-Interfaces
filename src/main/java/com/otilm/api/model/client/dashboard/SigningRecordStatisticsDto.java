/**
 * Statistics for the Signing Records dashboard. Every figure is sourced from the shared {@code signing_record} table
 * (never per-instance metrics) and is security-filtered identically to the Signing Records list endpoint, so the
 * numbers are cluster-wide consistent and scoped to the signing profiles the caller may access.
 *
 * <p>
 * A retained row is not the same as a signing that happened: recording is opt-in per signing profile and retention
 * deletes rows, so counts describe what is currently <em>retained</em>.
